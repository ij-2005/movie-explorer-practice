Created a simple movie explorer with the use of API from https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started. So huge credits for them (also credited inside the website). ApiKey is exposed, since it is just a free API, I don't really mind :D. Just practicing vanilla html css js before learning a framework, Thanks for reading!

extra message, just recently learned that github doesn't accept apis from a http only api. I would update soon! it only works locally for now
